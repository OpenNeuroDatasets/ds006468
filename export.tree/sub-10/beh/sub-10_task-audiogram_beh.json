    "Instructions": "You should listen carefully to the presented sinusoidal tone pulses at different frequencies, which gradually increase in sound level. When the tone pulses become clearly perceivable, you should press a button. ",
    "TaskDescription": "Participants listened to monaural sinusoidal tone pulses of different frequencies presented via headphones in a sound booth. Frequencies increased stepwise [125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000] Hz. Sound level increased in 5 dB steps until participants could perceive the tone pulses. Participants pressed a button when the tone pulses became perceivable. The procedure was conducted twice for each frequency. The measured level of the tone pulse is denoted as the hearing threshold for that specific frequency.",
