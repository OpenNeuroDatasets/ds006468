    "FiducialsDescription": "Anatomical landmarks \u2014 the nasion (NAS), left preauricular point (LPA), and right preauricular point (RPA)\u2014 were digitized using a Polhemus tracking system. In addition, head shape points were also recorded with the same system to support accurate coregistration. First, the anatomical landmarks were identified and marked in the anatomical MRI. For coregistration, the corresponding landmark positions from the MRI and the MEG digitization were aligned and matched. Subsequently, the head shape points were used to further refine the coregistration using an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The final coregistration was then visually inspected and manually adjusted if necessary to ensure accurate alignment. "
