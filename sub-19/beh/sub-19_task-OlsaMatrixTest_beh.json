    "Instructions": "You will hear 20 sentences presented in background noise. The intelligibility of the sentences will vary.  After each sentence, repeat the words you understood. If you did not understand anything, simply say, 'Nothing understood'.",
    "TaskDescription": "Participants underwent a standardized speech test inside the MEG to determine the Speech Reception Threshold (SRT). Using the same insert earphones as in the MEG experiment, they listened to 20 sentences from the Oldenburger Matrix Test, presented at a constant noise level of 65 dB SPL with varying signal-to-noise ratios. After each sentence, participants repeated the words they understood, which were logged by the experimenter. A psychometric function was fitted to the response data to determine the SRT.",
