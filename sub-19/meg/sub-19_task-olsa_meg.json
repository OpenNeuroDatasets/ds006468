    "Instructions": "You will hear sentences from the Oldenburger Sentence Test (OLSA). After a random number of sentences, a question will appear on the screen. You will always have two answer options, and your task is to select the word you understood. The left button always corresponds to 'green', and the right button to 'yellow'. If you're unsure, please guess. If you do not respond within 4 seconds, your answer will automatically be marked as incorrect.",
    "TaskDescription": "Participants listened to 120 sentences from the Oldenburger Sentence Test (OLSA). Each sentence followed a fixed syntactic structure consisting of five categories: name, verb, number, adjective, and noun (e.g., 'Peter kauft f\u00fcnf rote Blumen'). Sentences were constructed from randomized combinations of 10 words per category, All stimuli were presented in background noise at a fixed sound pressure level of 65 dB SPL, with six levels of intelligibility: 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, and 95%. Each intelligibility level comprised 20 sentences, and the sentence order was randomized across the session. The sentences were presented via insert earphones."
